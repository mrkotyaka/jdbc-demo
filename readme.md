# Migration* task (task marked with an asterisk)

## Description

This task is optional and does not affect your final grade.

It's time to practice working with migration mechanisms.

**What you need to do**

1. Rewrite the logic of the [Data Access Object (DAO) layer](../task1/README.md) task so that your application works with migrations. It doesn't matter whether you choose Flyway or Liquibase.

2. Post the written code in a separate repository on GitHub and attach a link to it in the comments to your homework assignment.
